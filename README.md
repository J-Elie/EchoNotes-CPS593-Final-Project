# EchoNotes 

EchoNotes is an in-progress full stack website for note-taking. Created as my final project for Web and Database Programmingâ€” CPS 593. 
EchoNotes will allow users to register an account, login, and start writing notes. Users will be able to add, read, edit, and delete any of their notes.
This project will utilize HTML, CSS, MySQL, Axios, Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript.
